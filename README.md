 [This link](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/NykUser/MyZman/tree/master/MyZmanPortable) can be used to download the portable Exe 


# Credits:
Core Zmanim calculations based on KosherJava https://github.com/KosherJava/zmanim, Using the NET port from https://github.com/Yitzchok/Zmanim.

The Code is released under the LGPL 2.1 license.

# Info:
Calculations use the NOAA algorithm by default, with option to use USNO.

The NET port (4/28/21 download) is part of the solution, as an C# project called Zmanim, it compiles itself into a Dll into zman\Resources\.

The vb zman project then compiles the DLL into itself, all the is needed to run thr propgrem is a stand alone exe.

Project uses an Embedded font "ArialUnicodeCompact", that is Arial Unicode MS with only Eng & Heb characters.


# Disclaimer:
Please double check before relying on these zmanim for halacha lemaaseh.
